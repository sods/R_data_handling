BMS109 - Data Handling R coding -- 
Lecturer: [Dr Marta Milo](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/bms/research/milo)

Semester 1A â€“ Level 1 Biomedical Science 2019/2020

## Description

This module aims to provide an understanding of how to explore data using a programming language. In particular we will use R language to manipulate, explore and visualise data. These sessions are designed at a very introductonary level, thus any extra reading/coding you might want to add, will further support you during your degree and beyond when you face analysis of data. 

### Teaching Methods 
Teaching will be perforned with a multidisciplinary approach, where concepts are directly embedded in the practical implementation of the tasks to solve, using programming tools implemented in R language. Detailed examples will be introduced in the lectures that consists in practical sessions guided by the instructor with the support of the demonstrators. You will implement the exercises on the computer during the sessions, creating a report with a set of instructions, called "script". Scripts are your laboratory books for these sessions and will provide you with a guide for data analysis and for any further training you might wish to take. 


### Study time for this module
The teaching consists of five practical sessions of 1.5 hour from week 2 to week 6.

Given the complexity of the time table for this academic year, please make sure you check on Blackboard(MOLE) for the correct location and time of practicals, as well as your group allocation.
